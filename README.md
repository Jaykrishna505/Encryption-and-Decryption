# Encryption-and-Decryption
Nowadays security has become a very essential factor. Encryption and decryption of files help to communicate securely. AES algorithm which is a very standard algorithm is used in this project. All types of files such as text files, audio files, video files, etc can be encrypted by using this code. By using this code, if the symmetric key is wrongly entered at the receiver side, the file sent by the sender will be destroyed.
